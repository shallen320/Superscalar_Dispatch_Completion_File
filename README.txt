In the previous project, a Superscalar Dispatch Unit is achieved using Tomasulo¡¯s algorithm. Though the previous Superscalar Dispatch Unit can issue and dispatch multiple instructions at the same time, it cannot handle exceptions due to the dynamic scheduling. In this project, a completion file is added to record the sequence of instructions. When an exception occurs, it can notify the operating system with the specific instruction causing the exception. In addition, the Load and Store Unit is improved with the capability to handle RAW hazards and Instruction Queue now can issue instructions with their PC address.
